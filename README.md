# new-npm-workflow

Just as the name implies, this is a simple setup for a basic npm workflow. It includes a file folder structure to start a basic static website project. 

## Getting Started
Just clone the repo, run `npm install` or `yarn install`, then `npm start`.

Navigate to http://localhost:1234 in your favorite browser and you should see a Hello World message. You're all set!
